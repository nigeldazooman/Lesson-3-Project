Lesson 8 Final Project Bug Report

Vulnerability: "Cross-Domain Misconfiguration"
Vulnerability Description: This warning indicates that the web application has misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies, potentially allowing unauthorized cross-domain access to sensitive resources.
Steps to Reproduce:
  1.
Impact: Severe
Potential Mitigation: We recommend performing the following mitigation steps.
  1. Review CORS Configuration: Ensure that CORS policies are properly configured to restrict cross-origin requests to trusted domains and resources. Use specific origins instead of wildcards whenever possible.
  2. Implement Secure CORS Policies: Apply appropriate CORS headers and policies to enforce restrictions on cross-origin requests based on the web application's security requirements.
  3. Validate Cross-Origin Requests: Implement server-side validation and authorization checks for cross-origin requests to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
  4. Regular Security Testing: Perform regular security testing, including web application security scans, to identify and remediate cross-domain misconfigurations and other security issues.
